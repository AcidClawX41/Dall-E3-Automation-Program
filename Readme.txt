Dall-E3 Automation Program
Description
The Dall-E3 Automation Program is a Windows Forms application designed to streamline the interaction with the Dall-E3 chatbox by automating the process of sending a specific message at regular intervals. This tool is particularly useful for users who need to send repetitive messages and simulate the 'Enter' keystroke without manual input.

Features
Automated Text Input: Sends a predefined message automatically.
Regular Intervals: Executes the command every two minutes.
Countdown Timer: Displays the remaining time until the next message send.
Control Buttons: Allows the user to start and stop the automation.
Usage
Upon launching the application, the user can start the automation process by clicking the 'Start' button. The program will then automatically paste the message "Draw me more of this pics!" into the active text field and press 'Enter'. The process will repeat every two minutes until the user decides to stop it by pressing the 'Stop' button.
